# Heart Disease Prediction: Logistic Regression & ADAM from Scratch

[Reasearch wtih EDA](REASEARCH.pdf)

This project is an educational implementation of **logistic regression** (binary and multi-class) and the **ADAM optimization algorithm** from scratch, without using machine learning libraries like Scikit-Learn or TensorFlow. 
The goal is to understand the fundamental mathematics and coding required to build these models from the ground up.

## Features

- **Binary Logistic Regression**: Classifies whether a patient has heart disease or not.
- **Multi-Class Logistic Regression**: Extends logistic regression to handle multiple classes.
- **ADAM Optimization**: Implements the ADAM optimizer for efficient gradient-based optimization.
- **Dataset Handling**: Prepares and processes heart disease data for training and evaluation.
